	<h2>Reflection</h2>

	<h3>Which existing websites out there most inspired your web site design thus far?</h3>
<!-- http://www.kylepenndesign.com -->
	<p>I definitely like Kyle Penn’s design site that you used as a reference. I like that it’s not your typical portfolio site, but it’s a creative way to showcase his work. Also, I definitely like the product pages on sites like Zara (more practical) and Veda (more experimental).</p>

	<h3>Which parts of the design are you most proud of?</h3>
	
	<p>I was most proud that I was able to float everything properly and convert everything into mobile as well.</p>

	<h3>What struggles did you encounter in your design process?</h3>

	<p>When I design, I always have multiple layouts I want to try, but try to incorporate them all at once. Eventually, I begin to cut back and simplify.</p>

	<h3>Which struggles did you encounter during page development?</h3>

	<p>Definitely floating sections properly was difficult but after looking over some resource links, I was able to fix.</p>

	<h3>What did you learn from making your project responsive?</h3>

	<p>I definitely learned what I felt would be most useful or relevant when converting from desktop to mobile.</p>

	<h2>Reviews</h2>
	<!-- http://www.sagmeisterwalsh.com/work/ -->
	<p>I personal love the layout of <a href="http://www.sagmeisterwalsh.com">this site</a>. For Sagmeister &amp; Walsh, the initial landing page was really intriguing and out of the box. A little fun fact: the home page looks different at night than it does during the day. I appreciate the hierarchy of the ‘Work’ page. You lead with the logo and nav bar with social icons and search, all at the top. I like that as you scroll, the header becomes less prominent but still stays fixed at the top. I also like how the thumbnails for each project are all the same dimension with equal whitespace between and not to emphasize or de-emphasize any projects. I think it’s really clean without a lot of text on pages as well. It’s straight to the point. The hover state is really cool too. The tiny slideshow is great for a quick look, but also is a great indicator that you can look into more images at a higher resolution and detail. However, when I clocked through to a project, had I not scrolled all the way to the bottom of the project’s landing page, I would not have known there was a description at the bottom. However (again), when I did get to the text, the choice of typefaces is really simple, appealing to the eye, and definitely helps with the flow. Overall, I’m in love with that site and I think it definitely serves its purpose in a clean unique way.</p>

	 <!-- http://cavs.mit.edu/ -->
	<p>In contrast, I think <a href="http://cavs.mit.edu/">this site</a> has the right idea but is a little confusing. I appreciate the minimalism of color scheme and choice of fonts. I don’t feel like the flow is there though. My eye immediately goes the blue “Center for Advanced Visual Studies”, but it isn’t too sure where to go next. I like the animations, but they do distract me a little from the main purpose of the site which I would assume is to learn more about the center, and possible have people sign up (?). After playing around a little more, I found the navigation. When clicking through some pages, like contact, I noticed that the floated sections are a little off and overlapping. However, I do appreciate the alignment in the contact section. But the at first glance, there isn’t too much differentiation between titles and the addresses themselves.</p>
